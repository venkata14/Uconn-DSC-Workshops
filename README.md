## UCONN Data Science Club Material

This is repository holding the IPYNB Notebooks and Datasets for our Workshop and Hands on Sessions.

Each meeting we will have around a 40 minute ~workshop~ on major data science libraries followed with a 20ish minute hands-on session on thw workshop. We will release the answers to these questions after the meeting. Furthermore, we will release the "title" questions that consist of easy, medium and hard questions that go towards the Discord title as well as certification at the end of the semester the following day.
- Please try doing the "title" questions as you will learn **a lot** doing these problems!
